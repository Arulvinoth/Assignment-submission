<p>
Charlotte's Web is a book of children's literature by American author E. B. White and illustrated by Garth Williams; it was published on October 15, 1952, by Harper & Brothers. The novel tells the story of a livestock pig named Wilbur and his friendship with a barn spider named Charlotte
</p>
<p>
After a little girl named Fern Arable pleads for the life of the runt of a litter of piglets, her father gives her the pig to nurture, and she names him Wilbur. She treats him as a pet, but a month later, Wilbur is no longer small, and is sold to Fern's uncle, Homer Zuckerman. In Zuckerman's barnyard, Wilbur yearns for companionship, but is snubbed by the other animals. He is befriended by a barn spider named Charlotte, whose web sits in a doorway overlooking Wilbur's enclosure. When Wilbur discovers that he is being raised for slaughter, she promises to hatch a plan guaranteed to spare his life. Fern often sits on a stool, listening to the animals' conversation, but over the course of the story, as she starts to mature, she begins to find other interests.

      As the summer passes, Charlotte ponders the question of how to save Wilbur.
At last, she comes up with a plan, which she proceeds to implement.
Reasoning that Zuckerman would not kill a famous pig, Charlotte 
weaves words and short phrases in praise of Wilbur into her web. 
This makes Wilbur, and the barn as a whole, into tourist attractions,
as many people believe the webs to be miracles.
Wilbur is eventually entered into the county fair, and Charlotte,
as well as the barn rat Templeton, accompany him. He fails to win the blue ribbon,
but is awarded a special prize by the judges. Charlotte hears the presentation
of the award over the public address system and realizes that the prize 
means Zuckerman will cherish Wilbur for as long as the pig lives, 
and will never slaughter him for his meat.
